    <h2>About Sarojini Naidu </h2>
   <p>
    Sarojini Naidu is known as "one of India's feminist luminaries".
    Sarojini Naidu Chattopadhyay was born in Hyderabad on 13 February 1879 to Aghorenath Chattopadhyay and Varada Sundari Devi.
    Her father was a Bengali Brahmin and the principal of Nizam College.
    Her mother wrote poetry in Bengali.
    Sarojini Naidu was an Indian political activist and poet.
    As a poet, Naidu was known as the "Nightingale of India".
    Edmund Gosse called her "the most accomplished living poet in India" in 1919.
    She was the former Governor of Uttar Pradesh.
    A proponent of civil rights, women's emancipation, and anti-imperialism, she played an important role in the Indian independence movement against the British Raj.
    Naidu's work as a poet earned her the sobriquet Nightingale of India. 
    Naidu died of cardiac arrest at 3:30 p.m. (IST) on 2 March 1949 at the Government House in Lucknow.
    Her last rites were performed at the Gomati River.
